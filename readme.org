This is a text I wrote as an initial overview of TeX and Friends for absolute beginners who want to get started with a bit of background. This is not a step-by-step introduction to TeX, but rather a signpost giving advice on how to find and use the relevant resources that are already there. It replaced the simple unordered list of resources on TeX I had published on my personal website before. The narrative used herein refers to the concept applied in my classes for TeX novices at the Fernuniversit√§t in Hagen office at Frankfurt am Main held in 2014 and 2015.

I keep improving on this guide. At first, I provided a raw XHTML version that was identical to the one you will find on my personal website. In September 2023, I switched to Org-Mode.
